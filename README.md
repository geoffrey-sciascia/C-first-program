# C-first-program

This is my first program I created following the C# getting started skill path on the Pluralsight platform.
It takes temperature data in either celsius or fahrenheit along with a humidity percentage for a location and returns a comfort index value to compare to other locations.
For now data is hardcoded, but I will update this to be enttered as I become more familiar and knowledgeable in the C# programming language stack.
It current compares comfort index data in may from San Francisco USA, Melbourne AUS, and Wellington NZ
