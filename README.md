# C-first-program

This is my first program I created following the C# getting started skill path on the Pluralsight platform. /n
It takes temperature data in either celsius or fahrenheit along with a humidity percentage for a location and returns a comfort index value to compare to other locations. /n
For now data is hardcoded, but I will update this to be entered into an input field as I become more familiar and knowledgeable in the C# programming language stack./n
It currently compares comfort index data in may from San Francisco USA, Melbourne AUS, and Wellington NZ. /n
